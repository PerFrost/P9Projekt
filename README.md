# P9Projekt
This project is written in Python, and utilizes MMPose and MediaPipe in order control PowerPoint presentations using hand poses.
Furthermore we have trained a TensorFlow model capable of recognizing the performed gestures for controlling a PowerPoint slide. 
For training the model we utilize software created by [[Kasuhito00]([https://github.com/Kazuhito00](https://github.com/Kazuhito00/hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe))](https://github.com/Kazuhito00/hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe)

In order to run the program the controller acts as main, which will invoke the UI where settings such as calibration and monitor selection can be performed.
